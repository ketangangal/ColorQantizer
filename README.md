# Color Quantization using k means clustering .

I have used k means clustering to reduce the number of colors present in the image. 

User Task:
Provide how many colors he wants to be in the image and image itself.

Code: 
step 1 : conversion of image into 3d array using matplotlib image library.
step 2 : Conversion of image from 3d to 2d array for k means.
step 3 : cluster the features into total no of colors provided by the user.
step 4 : sampling the cluster_centers into image length.
step 5 : reshape image from 2d to 3d array.
step 6 : show image using plt.show() function.

Output:
Image with only number of colors provided by the user.
